# tic-tac-toe

A simple game of tic-tac-toe made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I am/was following the TheOdinProject's Full stack JavaScript course and that where I got the idea for this project.

The game is available [here](https://nagyb3.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) hosted by Github Pages.

You are also able to change the Player's names by click on the blue icons.
